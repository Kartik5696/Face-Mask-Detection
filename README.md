# Face-Mask-Detection

Our two-phase COVID-19 face mask detector, detailing how computer vision/deep learning pipeline will be implemented. I used with and without mask dataset to train our custom face mask detector. Then I implemented a Python script to train a face mask detector on our dataset using Keras and TensorFlow. I used this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, I proceed to implement Python scripts used to detect face masks in real-time video streams.
